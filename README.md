Code for the paper "Active gels, heavy tails, and the cytoskeleton"
Written by Brian Camley and Daniel Swartz

To generate many of the plots and illustrate how the analysis works, the code "generate_default_plots.m" loads a file generated by the simulation and computes the van Hove distributions, fits them to the Levy form, and generates our plots. The name of the file analyzed is specified in generate_default_plots.m

Quasi-2D results use the Struve functions written by T.P. Theodoulidis (Theo2); these are included. See license_for_struve_functions.txt
